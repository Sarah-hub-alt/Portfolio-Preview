    <p style="color:white;font-size:larger"><b>I am a Kenyan web developer with a passion for building clean, 
        accessible, and responsive websites.
         My interest in technology began with a curiosity about how digital platforms work behind the scenes, 
         and over time that curiosity grew into a commitment to mastering the craft of web development.
          I enjoy experimenting with code, learning new frameworks, and exploring creative ways to turn ideas into interactive experiences.<br>
Beyond my technical journey, I draw inspiration from photography,
 which sharpens my ability to notice detail and composition—qualities I carry into my design and coding work. 
 I also enjoy reading novels, as stories give me fresh perspectives, broaden my imagination, 
 and encourage me to think critically. These hobbies complement my professional life by shaping how I approach problem-solving and creativity.<br>
My goal as a developer is not only to improve my skills but also to contribute to meaningful projects that have a real impact on people.
 I am enthusiastic about collaborating with others, sharing knowledge,
  and continually growing in this ever-changing field.<br>
   For me, web development is more than just code—it is an opportunity to create solutions that are functional, engaging, and purposeful.</b></p>
